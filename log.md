### Day 0: April 15, 2021


**Today's Progress**: .

**Thoughts:**.#100daysofcode   Day 1

*  interesting day to be back coding spent most time on the IDE configuring it  
*started with javascript  basics  
* was quite stumped  in trying to run the code from visual studio code and trying to push to github

* went overboard  with the IDE and themes
