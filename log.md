**Today's Progress**: .

**Thoughts:**.#100daysofcode   Day 1

*  interesting day to be back coding spent most time on the IDE configuring it  
*started with javascript  basics  
* was quite stumped  in trying to run the code from visual studio code and trying to push to github

* went overboard  with the IDE and themes

**Thoughts:**.#100daysofcode   Day 3

*  strange doing code on saturday but the habit starting to kick in now

* today we continue with Chained if statement and Objects   
* we did a Golf and Cards javascript programs to solidify the concepts

**Thoughts:**.#100daysofcode   Day 4

* tried to squeeze at least 30 minutes on code on sunday  very strange also doing code on sunday but we motivated.

* today we moved onto Objects and lots emphasis on the If statement,while loops   
* The Record collection Object was pretty cool  to understand the concept  
* I am fascinated at the progress on Day 4 and imagine the kind of progress would have made we moved on double digits dates like day 20.


Thoughts:.#100daysofcode Day 5

* i did close 2 hours of combined videos and programming  made really good progress
* i am trying to rush through the tutorials and focus on exercises that will solidify the concepts
* the destructuring concept is really interesting  the pieces are starting to come together.
* i feel the concepts are starting to be hard and now i need to slow down.
