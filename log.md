**Thoughts:**.#100daysofcode   Day 1

*  interesting day to be back coding spent most time on the IDE configuring it  
*started with javascript  basics  
* was quite stumped  in trying to run the code from visual studio code and trying to push to github

* went overboard  with the IDE and themes

**Thoughts:**.#100daysofcode   Day 2

*  started the day nicely  fatigue start to creep now  but made good progress on arrays and functions
* really need to understand the basics so take it slowly 

* i have and idea of the Project i want to do
